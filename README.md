# Next Word Prediction 📝🤖

Welcome to the **Next Word Prediction** repository! This project is part of my university course on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and demonstrates the use of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to predict the next word in a sequence.  


## 💻 Project Overview  
- **Course**: Natural Language Processing  
- **Objective**: Build and train an LSTM-based model to predict the next word in a given text sequence.  
- **Model Details**:  
  - Trained for **30 epochs**  
  - Optimized for sequence prediction using preprocessed text data.  
- **Deliverable**: A comprehensive **Jupyter Notebook** detailing the implementation, training process, and results.


## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow / Keras (for building and training the LSTM model)  
  - NumPy (data manipulation)  
  - Pandas (data preprocessing)  
  - Matplotlib (visualizations)  


## 🚀 Key Highlights  
- Preprocessed text data for optimal input to the LSTM model.  
- Built an LSTM model architecture tailored for word prediction tasks.  
- Trained the model over **30 epochs**, achieving meaningful next-word predictions.  
- Documented the entire process in a **Jupyter Notebook** for clarity and reproducibility.
